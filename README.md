A pixel-art DJ companion that lives inside Claude Code. It plays music, shows lyrics, celebrates when you commit, and panics with you when tests fail.

[中文文档](README_CN.md) ／ [日本語](README_JP.md)

## Features

- **MCP server** — 21 tools so you can tell Claude "play some lofi", "skip this", "what's playing" and it just works.
- **Music sources** — Apple Music (AppleScript, no GUI needed), local files (afplay), QQ Music (search + preview).
- **Pixel UI** — Album art in half-block ANSI, GameBoy retro border, pseudo-spectrum equalizer.
- **DJ Buddy** — A headphones-wearing pixel character that reacts to your coding state. Tests failing? It panics with you.
- **Vibe engine** — CC hooks track what you're doing in real time and shift the mood. `git commit`? Victory pose. Tests explode? Panic mode.
- **Statusline** — One line: face + current track + progress bar.
- **Focus mode** — Built-in 25/5 Pomodoro timer shown in the statusline.

## Installation

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaychempan/coding-with-beat/main/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaychempan/coding-with-beat.git
cd coding-with-beat
./install.sh
```

Open a new shell and a new Claude Code session. When `(•_•)` appears in the statusline, you're good.

## Usage

### Just talk to Claude

```
play some lofi
skip this track
what's playing
pause
```

### `/cwb` command

```
/cwb play 周杰伦          # search and play

/cwb next
/cwb pause
/cwb np                   # now playing
